To fix this, we need to get the actual boolean value of the sum check. We can explicitly convert the sum to a boolean or check if the sum is greater than 0. Also, the second part of the `if` condition `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped[non_nan_qc_mask].shape[0] > 0` should be evaluated carefully as `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped[non_nan_qc_mask]` might result in an array of shape (n, 1), so checking the first dimension is correct, but ensuring it's not empty is also important.

This is happening because `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped` has dimensions (number of QC samples, 1), while `non_nan_qc_mask_np` has the size of the `qc_intensities` Series (number of QC samples). The mask `non_nan_qc_mask` is correctly generated based on the QC intensities for the current feature, but when it's applied to `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped` (which is a 2D array), the indexing needs to match the first dimension (axis 0), which corresponds to the number of QC samples. The error message \"size of axis is 125 but size of corresponding boolean axis is 2\" is confusing, as the size of axis 0 of `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped` should be the number of QC samples, not 125, and the size of `non_nan_qc_mask_np` should also be the number of QC samples. This might indicate that `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped` is not correctly reflecting the QC samples. Let's re-examine how `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped` is created. It is derived from `all_batches_encoded` using `qc_samples_mask`. This seems correct. The issue might be how the boolean mask is applied to the 2D array. When indexing a 2D NumPy array with a 1D boolean array, the mask is applied to the first axis (rows). So `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped[non_nan_qc_mask_np]` should work correctly if the sizes match. The error message \"size of axis is 125 but size of corresponding boolean axis is 2\" is still puzzling. Let's add some debugging print statements to check the shapes and sizes of the arrays involved just before the line causing the error.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"1tzwn6Km9kQH","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1753134581949,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":32947,"user":{"displayName":"Cam","userId":"02267251391328370889"}},"outputId":"a12b38fc-e20c-41c4-cbda-404bb303f6f4"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","def apply_serff_correction(df):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Applies the SERFF batch correction method to the input DataFrame.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        df: pandas DataFrame with a MultiIndex column (batch, sample)\n","            and features as index.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        pandas DataFrame with batch-corrected values, same structure as input df.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    corrected_df = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index, columns=df.columns)\n","\n","    # Extract batch information for all samples\n","    all_batches = df.columns.get_level_values('batch').tolist()\n","\n","    # Numerically encode batch information for all samples\n","    batch_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n","    all_batches_encoded = batch_encoder.fit_transform(all_batches)\n","\n","    # Reshape for scikit-learn (needs to be 2D)\n","    all_batches_encoded_reshaped = all_batches_encoded.reshape(-1, 1)\n","\n","    # Identify QC samples mask once\n","    qc_samples_mask = df.columns.get_level_values('sample').str.startswith('QC')\n","\n","    for feature_name in df.index:\n","        # Extract intensity values for the current feature across all samples\n","        feature_intensities = df.loc[feature_name]\n","\n","        # Extract intensity values for QC samples for the current feature by selecting columns first\n","        qc_intensities = df.loc[feature_name, qc_samples_mask]\n","\n","        # Extract batch information and encoded batch information for QC samples\n","        qc_batches_encoded = all_batches_encoded[qc_samples_mask]\n","        qc_batches_encoded_reshaped = qc_batches_encoded.reshape(-1, 1)\n","\n","        # Train Random Forest Regressor on QC data\n","        # Handle potential missing values in QC intensities\n","        non_nan_qc_mask = ~qc_intensities.isna()\n","\n","        # Ensure non_nan_qc_mask is a numpy array for reliable boolean operations\n","        non_nan_qc_mask_np = non_nan_qc_mask.values\n","\n","        # Debugging prints to check shapes\n","        print(f\"Feature: {feature_name}\")\n","        print(f\"Shape of qc_intensities: {qc_intensities.shape}\")\n","        print(f\"Shape of non_nan_qc_mask: {non_nan_qc_mask.shape}\")\n","        print(f\"Shape of non_nan_qc_mask_np: {non_nan_qc_mask_np.shape}\")\n","        print(f\"Shape of qc_batches_encoded: {qc_batches_encoded.shape}\")\n","        print(f\"Shape of qc_batches_encoded_reshaped: {qc_batches_encoded_reshaped.shape}\")\n","\n","\n","        # Ensure there are non-NaN QC values to train\n","        if non_nan_qc_mask_np.sum() > 0:\n","            # Select only the non-NaN QC intensities and corresponding encoded batches for training\n","            qc_intensities_train = qc_intensities[non_nan_qc_mask]\n","            # This is the line causing the error:\n","            qc_batches_encoded_reshaped_train = qc_batches_encoded_reshaped[non_nan_qc_mask_np] # Use the numpy boolean mask\n","\n","\n","            # Ensure consistent number of samples between features and target\n","            if len(qc_intensities_train) == qc_batches_encoded_reshaped_train.shape[0]:\n","                rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n","                rf_model.fit(qc_batches_encoded_reshaped_train, qc_intensities_train)\n","\n","                # Predict systematic error for all samples\n","                predicted_error = rf_model.predict(all_batches_encoded_reshaped)\n","\n","                # Subtract predicted error from original intensities\n","                corrected_intensities = feature_intensities - predicted_error\n","            else:\n","                # Handle cases where non_nan_qc_mask somehow causes a mismatch\n","                print(f\"Warning: Mismatch in sample count for feature {feature_name}.

(125, 1) for the reshaped array), but for some features like 'CSH_negESI #206', the shape of `qc_intensities`, `non_nan_qc_mask`, and `non_nan_qc_mask_np` is (2, 125), while `qc_batches_encoded` and `qc_batches_encoded_reshaped` are (125,) and (125, 1) respectively. This indicates that `df.loc[feature_name, qc_samples_mask]` is returning a 2D DataFrame (2 rows, 125 columns) instead of a 1D Series (125 elements) for certain features. This is unexpected given the DataFrame structure where features are rows and samples are columns. It's likely due to duplicate feature names in the index. When `df.loc[feature_name, qc_samples_mask]` encounters duplicate index values, it returns a DataFrame containing all rows with that index value. To fix this, we need to handle duplicate index values before iterating through features. We can either aggregate duplicate rows (e.g., by taking the mean) or process them individually. Given the nature of omics data, processing them individually seems more appropriate to avoid unintended data transformation. The simplest approach is to iterate through the *unique* feature names first, and then for each unique name, select the corresponding row(s) from the DataFrame. If there are duplicates, we can process each duplicate row separately. However, the SERFF method is described as applying feature by feature, implying unique features. Let's first identify if there are duplicate index values and then adjust the iteration to handle them, ensuring we are always working with a single row (Series) for a given feature instance when applying the correction. If there are duplicates, we should process each instance of the feature separately.\n","\n","Let's modify the loop to iterate through the index directly and handle potential duplicates by ensuring we are processing a single row (Series) at a time. We can use `df.iterrows()` or iterate through the index and use `df.loc[index_value]` which might return a Series or a DataFrame if duplicates exist. If it's a DataFrame, we can iterate through its rows. A more robust way is to iterate through the index and explicitly check if `df.loc[feature_name]` returns a Series or a DataFrame.\n","\n","Let's refine the iteration and data extraction to ensure we are always working with a 1D Series for `feature_intensities` and `qc_intensities`.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"51gpnIpH9x9Q","outputId":"9aebd838-adb6-42fe-c278-daf40095723d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","def apply_serff_correction(df):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Applies the SERFF batch correction method to the input DataFrame.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        df: pandas DataFrame with a MultiIndex column (batch, sample)\n","            and features as index.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        pandas DataFrame with batch-corrected values, same structure as input df.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Create a copy to store corrected data to avoid modifying the original DataFrame\n","    corrected_df = df.copy()\n","\n","    # Extract batch information for all samples\n","    all_batches = df.columns.get_level_values('batch').tolist()\n","\n","    # Numerically encode batch information for all samples\n","    batch_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n","    all_batches_encoded = batch_encoder.fit_transform(all_batches)\n","\n","    # Reshape for scikit-learn (needs to be 2D)\n","    all_batches_encoded_reshaped = all_batches_encoded.reshape(-1, 1)\n","\n","    # Identify QC samples mask once\n","    qc_samples_mask = df.columns.get_level_values('sample').str.startswith('QC')\n","\n","    # Extract batch information and encoded batch information for QC samples once\n","    qc_batches_encoded = all_batches_encoded[qc_samples_mask]\n","    qc_batches_encoded_reshaped = qc_batches_encoded.reshape(-1, 1)\n","\n","    # Iterate through each row index to handle potential duplicate feature names\n","    for index_value in df.index:\n","        # Select the row(s) corresponding to the current index value\n","        feature_data = df.loc[index_value]\n","\n","        # Check if feature_data is a Series (unique index) or DataFrame (duplicate index)\n","        if isinstance(feature_data, pd.Series):\n","            # It's a single feature instance\n","            feature_intensities = feature_data\n","            feature_index = index_value # The index for corrected_df\n","\n","            # Extract intensity values for QC samples for the current feature instance\n","            qc_intensities = feature_intensities[qc_samples_mask]\n","\n","            # Handle potential missing values in QC intensities\n","            non_nan_qc_mask = ~qc_intensities.isna()\n","            non_nan_qc_mask_np = non_nan_qc_mask.values\n","\n","            # Ensure there are non-NaN QC values to train\n","            if non_nan_qc_mask_np.sum() > 0:\n","                # Select only the non-NaN QC intensities and corresponding encoded batches for training\n","                qc_intensities_train = qc_intensities[non_nan_qc_mask]\n","                qc_batches_encoded_reshaped_train = qc_batches_encoded_reshaped[non_nan_qc_mask_np]\n","\n","                # Ensure consistent number of samples between features and target\n","                if len(qc_intensities_train) == qc_batches_encoded_reshaped_train.shape[0]:\n","                    rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n","                    rf_model.fit(qc_batches_encoded_reshaped_train, qc_intensities_train)\n","\n","                    # Predict systematic error for all samples\n","                    predicted_error = rf_model.predict(all_batches_encoded_reshaped)\n","\n","                    # Subtract predicted error from original intensities\n","                    corrected_intensities = feature_intensities - predicted_error\n","\n","                    # Store the batch-corrected values in the copied DataFrame\n","                    corrected_df.loc[feature_index] = corrected_intensities\n","                else:\n","                    print(f\"Warning: Mismatch in sample count for feature {index_value}.
